A paragraph is a brief piece of writing that's around seven to ten sentences long.
The paragraph form refers to a group of sentences focusing on a single topic. 
There are three main parts of a paragraph: Topic sentence - it has the main idea. 
Supporting sentences - details that relate to and support the topic sentence.
A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.
Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose
